Assignment 2: Social Media Network Analyzer
Skills Tested: Graph Algorithms, Object Manipulation, Recursion

Difficulty: Hard

Problem Statement
Create a social network analysis tool that processes user connections, posts, and interactions.

Requirements
findMutualFriends(userId1, userId2, network)

Return array of user IDs who are friends with both users
Optimize for large networks (10,000+ users)
calculateInfluenceScore(userId, network)

Score based on: followers count, engagement rate, friend connections
Formula: (followers × 0.5) + (avgLikesPerPost × 0.3) + (mutualConnections × 0.2)
Return normalized score (0-100)
findConnectionPath(userId1, userId2, network, maxDepth)

Find shortest connection path between two users
Return array of user IDs representing the path
Return null if no path exists within maxDepth
recommendFriends(userId, network, count)

Suggest friends based on mutual connections
Exclude existing friends and the user themselves
Return top N recommendations with relevance scores
detectCommunities(network, minSize)

Identify closely connected groups of users
Community = users with at least 50% connections within group
Return array of arrays (each inner array is a community)
Sample Data Structure
const network = {
  users: [
    {
      userId: "U001",
      name: "Alice",
      friends: ["U002", "U003", "U004"],
      followers: 1500,
      posts: [
        { postId: "P001", likes: 150, comments: 20 },
        { postId: "P002", likes: 200, comments: 35 }
      ]
    }
  ]
};
Evaluation Criteria
